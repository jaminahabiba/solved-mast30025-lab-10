 <li>Consider again the data from Question 5 from the Week 8 lab. In a manufacturing plant, filtersare used to remove pollutants. We are interested in comparing the lifespan of 5 different types of filters. Six filters of each type are tested, and the time to failure in hours is given in the dataset filters (on the website, in csv format).

  <ul>

   <li>Calculate <em>s</em><sup>2</sup>.</li>

   <li>Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference in lifespan between filter types 3 and 4.</li>

   <li>Show that the hypothesis that the filters all have the same lifespan is testable.</li>

   <li>Test this hypothesis, using matrix theory.</li>

   <li>Test the same hypothesis using the linearHypothesis function from the car</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Derive a formula for a prediction interval for <strong>t</strong><em><sup>T</sup></em><em>β </em>in the less than full rank model.</li>

 <li>Consider a one-way classification model with three levels. To test <em>τ</em><sub>1 </sub>= <em>τ</em><sub>2 </sub>= <em>τ</em><sub>3 </sub>we could use either of the following matrices:</li>

</ol>

<em> .</em>

Show that the test statistics formed using these two matrices are the same.

Hint: find <em>A </em>such that <em>AC</em><sub>1 </sub>= <em>C</em><sub>2</sub>.

 <li>An industrial psychologist is investigating absenteeism among production-line workers, based ondifferent types of work hours: (1) 4-day week with a 10-hour day, (2) 5-day week with a flexible 8hour day, and (3) 5-day week with a structured 8-hour day. A study is conducted and the following data obtained of the average number of days missed:</li>

They also find <em>s</em><sup>2 </sup>= 110<em>.</em>15.

<ul>

 <li>Test the hypothesis that the work plan has no effect on the absenteeism.</li>

 <li>Test the hypothesis that work plans 1 and 3 have the same rate of absenteeism.</li>

</ul>
